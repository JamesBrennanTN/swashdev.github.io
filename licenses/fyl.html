  with it as long as you retain this notice and don't hold me liable for any
  damages; there is no warranty.  In exchange, if you ever find yourself
  thinking "I can't do this," or "I'll never be that good," I want you to
  stop, take a deep breath, and say "Yes I can," "Yes, I will," or "I just
  need to keep practicing."  Then prove you can.  Don't prove it to me; don't
  prove it to your friends and family; don't prove it to your boss; prove it
  to yourself.  You deserve it, and you owe it to yourself.  It takes time,
  but you're worth spending time on.  This software is already free; now free
  yourself.   - Philip Pavlick
