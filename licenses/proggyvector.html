  with it as long as you retain this notice and don't hold me liable for any
  damages; there is no warranty.  In exchange, if you ever find yourself
  thinking "I can't do this," or "I'll never be that good," I want you to
  stop, take a deep breath, and say "Yes I can," "Yes, I will," or "I just
  need to keep practicing."  Then prove you can.  Don't prove it to me; don't
  prove it to your friends and family; don't prove it to your boss; prove it
  to yourself.  You deserve it, and you owe it to yourself.  It takes time,
  but you're worth spending time on.  This software is already free; now free
  yourself.   - Philip Pavlick

        This website uses the
        <span style="font-family: ProggyVector;">ProggyVector</span> font in
        a lot of places, both for general styling and as a monospace font.
        These font files were retrieved from
   <a href="https://github.com/bluescan/proggyfonts/tree/master/ProggyVector">
        this GitHub page</a> on 2019-08-06.  What follows is a recreation of
        the "Readme And Licensing" file which is included with said font.  The
        original version can be found
        <a href="../fonts/readme-proggyvector.txt">here</a> or on the
        previously-linked GitHub page.

        The "ProggyVector Regular" font is a modified version of the Hack Font.
        The modifications were made using the Bird Font editor. Both the
        modifications made by SourceFoundry for Hack and my subsequent
        modifications are licensed under MIT. However, Hack started life out
        elsewhere, so please read the licensing information below. There's
        nothing arduous. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have ONLY tested the non-Mac ttf and otf files in Windows. I have
        NOT tested the included svg, eot, and woff files. The web format woff
        file was generated by importing the otf into FontForge and exporting.
        I have also included the FontForge (sfd) and BirdFont (.birdfont)
        project files in case anyone would like to make further edits.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my opinion, Windows did a better job rendering the ttf version over
        the otf version (even though the otf supports cubic beziers which
        should not be approximations of the authored curves). I'm using the
        ttf in any case.
