The "Free Yourself" License, Revision 1:

<swashdev@pm.me> wrote this file.  Feel free to do whatever you want
with it as long as you retain this notice and don't hold me liable for any
damages; there is no warranty.  In exchange, if you ever find yourself
thinking "I can't do this," or "I'll never be that good," I want you to
stop, take a deep breath, and say "Yes I can," "Yes, I will," or "I just
need to keep practicing."  Then prove you can.  Don't prove it to me; don't
prove it to your friends and family; don't prove it to your boss; prove it
to yourself.  You deserve it, and you owe it to yourself.  It takes time,
but you're worth spending time on.  This software is already free; now free
yourself.   - Philip Pavlick
