  stop, take a deep breath, and say "Yes I can," "Yes, I will," or "I just

  prove it to your friends and family; don't prove it to your boss; prove it
  to yourself.  You deserve it, and you owe it to yourself.  It takes time,
  but you're worth spending time on.  This software is already free; now free
  yourself.   - Philip Pavlick

          Welcome to Philip Pavlick's website!  As you can see, this is still
          under construction as I either build my website or ask a friend to
          build one for me, whichever comes first.
        </p>

        <p>
          Okay, fine, it's still essentially a "Hello World" page, but at
          least I put a little effort into making it look nice this time.
